        <h2>What is sexual harassmentand sexual assault?</h2>
        <p>Sexual harassment is term that is comprised of various actions including physical and verbal harassment, unwelcome sexual advances, or and other physical attention in any learning environment or workplace. This violates civil laws because people should be able to work and learn without getting harassed by their peers. Sexual assault is a term used to define criminal offences including rape, attempted rape, unwanted sexual touching, and pressuring a victim to perform sexual acts on the perpetrator's body against their own volition. </p>

      <h4>Many teens and young women have exerpienced sexual harassment, sexual assault, or both. See below for the frightening factual statisitcs of those affected. </h4>
      <p>1. For girls between the age 15 to 19 who have been in relationships, approximately 24% (nearly one in four teens) experienced some form of physical or sexual violence from their partner. In the past twelve months (as of March 2021), sixteen percent of females between the age of 15 to 24 have experienced sexual violence (whether in a relationship or not), globally. (Source: World Health Organization, on behalf of the United Nations Inter-Agency Working Group on Violence Against Women Estimation and Data (2021). Violence against women prevalence estimates, 2018) </p>

      <p>2. All over the world, 15 million teens (all between the ages of 15 to 19) have experienced forced sex or rape. According to UNICEF, only one percent of victims have searched for professional aid (based on a study of 30 countries). (Source: UNICEF (2017). A Familiar Face: Violence in the lives of children and adolescents, p. 73, 82) </p>

      <p>3. In the United States, approximately 10 million girls under the age of 18 (8%) experienced rape or attempted rape. This makes the victim much more likely to re-experience sexual assault as an adult. (Source: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. (n.d.) Sexual violence in youth: Findings from the 2012 National Intimate Partner and Sexual Violence Survey. Retrieved from https://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/pdf/2012FindingsonSVinYouth.pdf) </p>

      <p>4. According to the The National Intimate Partner and Sexual Violence Survey, 30.1% (one in three) of victims who experienced completed rape had been raped for the first time between 11 and 17 years old. (Source: The National Intimate Partner and Sexual Violence Survey (NISVS): 2010-2012 state report.
