        <p>1. Create distraction that will draw the perpetrators attention away from the victim like creating a loud noise. However, maintain a healthy distance from where the situation is taking place to retain your safety. </p>
        <p>2. Bring in an authority figure like a security guard, the police, a teacher, or adminstrator. </p>
        <p>3. Work with another bystander, student, or friend that is nearby to help the victim. </p>
        <p>4. Talk to the victim and ask them if they need help (for example walking with them if they are afraid to get attacked while walking alone.) </p>
